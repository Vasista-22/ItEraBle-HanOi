Iterative solution to the towers of hanoi problem

You need to give an input of number of discs you wish to transfer from first tower to the third tower.
The entire sequence of steps would be displayed on the standard output of your screen.
P.S: As is the case with recursive solution, inputs beyond 20 would take larger time, but will definitely be completed.
